                        <p class="card-text">The fall armyworm (<em>Spodoptera frugiperda</em>) poses a significant threat to
                            maize (<em>Zea mays</em>) crops worldwide, leading to substantial economic losses. Sustainable
                            agriculture necessitates the development of effective and environmentally friendly pest control
                            methods. Piperamides, naturally occurring compounds found in <em>Piper</em> species, have emerged as
                            promising candidates for biopesticide development due to their insecticidal and allelopathic
                            properties.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Previous research has highlighted the selective phytotoxic effects of piperamides
                            on various plant species. Tavares et al. (2011) investigated the inhibitory activity of piperine—a
                            type of piperamide—on seed germination and seedling growth in both monocotyledonous and
                            dicotyledonous plants. Their findings revealed a concentration-dependent effect: piperine inhibited
                            germination in dicotyledons such as <em>Bidens pilosa</em>, <em>Cucumis sativus</em>, and
                            <em>Lactuca sativa</em>by up to 12.82% at 5 mg/kg, while stimulating germination in the
                            monocotyledonous <em>Allium cepa</em> by 30.43% at the same concentration. Additionally, piperine
                            significantly reduced the seedling length in dicotyledons, suggesting its potential utility in
                            organic weed management due to its selective allelopathic activity.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Given these selective effects, it is crucial to assess whether piperamides
                            adversely affect maize—a monocotyledon—when used as a biopesticide against the fall armyworm.
                            Understanding the impact of piperamides on maize seed germination and seedling growth is essential
                            to ensure their safe application in maize cultivation. Specifically, we aim to evaluate the effects
                            of piperamides present in the substrate on the germination and growth of maize seeds under
                            controlled conditions (Mendes et al., 2021), simulating realistic field scenarios where the
                            biopesticide would be applied via crop spraying.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">To address this, we investigated three concentrations of piperamides (0.02%, 0.2%,
                            and 2%) applied directly to the substrate. These concentrations were selected based on preliminary
                            explorations with the aim of a biopesticide formulation with a concentration around 2%. By assessing
                            the phytotoxic effects of piperamides at these concentrations, we seek to determine whether
                            piperamide-based biopesticides can be safely used in maize fields without hindering seed germination
                            and seedling development.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Our study provides valuable insights for the development of effective and safe
                            piperamide-based biopesticides, balancing pest control efficacy with crop safety. The findings will
                            inform strategies for the use of piperamides in maize cultivation, ensuring that the benefits of
                            controlling the fall armyworm do not compromise crop viability.</p>

                        <p>Piperamide treatments were prepared by diluting a stock solution of piperamides at 10% to create
                            three solutions corresponding to the concentrations used in each treatment (Table 1). For each
                            treatment, 25 mL of the appropriate piperamide solution was taken and mixed thoroughly with 30 grams
                            of vermiculite in a container. The mixture was agitated to ensure even distribution of the solution
                            throughout the substrate. The treated vermiculite was then left uncovered in a dark, well-ventilated
                            area for three days to allow the alcohol from the solutions to evaporate completely.</p>

                        <h5>Preparation of Maize Seeds</h5>
                        <p>The maize seeds were purchased from a local supermarket, distributed by the brand Verde Valle, and
                            specifically of the “Maíz Palomero” variety. The seeds were first washed with plain water and then
                            placed in a beaker filled with water for hydration. The seeds were left to soak for 24 hours to
                            promote germination and ensure uniform hydration (at least initially) across all experimental
                            groups.</p>
                        <h5>Seed Distribution, Incubation and Monitoring</h5>
                        <p>For each treatment, 90 maize seeds were distributed across three Petri dishes containing the treated
                            vermiculite. The dishes were then placed in an incubator set to a temperature of 25°C with a 12-hour
                            light/12-hour dark photoperiod. Monitoring of germination was conducted on days 1, 4, and 7 after
                            the seeds were placed in the Petri dishes. During each monitoring period, the number of germinated
                            seeds in each Petri dish was counted individually.</p>
                        <h5>Statistical Analysis</h5>
                        <p>Data obtained from seed germination monitoring on days 1, 4, and 7 were analyzed to determine the
                            effects of piperamide treatments on maize seed germination. Normality of the germination data was
                            assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, while homoscedasticity was evaluated with Levene's test. Given
                            the absence of normality or homoscedasticity in some datasets, non-parametric statistical tests were
                            applied. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare germination rates across treatments, followed
                            by Dunn's post hoc test with Bonferroni correction to identify pairwise differences between groups.
                            Additionally, a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to evaluate the effect
                            of time (days) on germination rates across treatments. All statistical analyses were performed using
                            Python, with a significance threshold set at p &lt; 0.05. Graphical representations of the data,
                            including boxplots, bar plots, and heatmaps, were generated to visualize differences between
                            treatments.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the phytotoxic effects of
                            piperamides on maize (<em>Zea mays</em>) seed germination and seedling development to determine
                            their suitability as biopesticides in maize cultivation. We investigated three concentrations of
                            piperamides (0.02%, 0.2%, y 2%) applied directly to the substrate and compared their effects to a
                            control group without piperamides. Our findings demonstrate a clear inhibitory effect of piperamides
                            on maize seed germination, which intensified with increasing concentrations. This dose-dependent
                            inhibition aligns with previous reports of piperamide phytotoxicity on dicotyledonous species but
                            reveals a concerning sensitivity in maize, a monocotyledon.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">The germination assays indicated that the control group exhibited significantly
                            higher germination rates compared to all piperamide-treated groups (Figure 3). Even at the lowest
                            concentration of 0.02%, piperamides significantly reduced germination rates, suggesting that maize
                            seeds are highly sensitive to these compounds. The inhibitory effect was most pronounced at the
                            highest concentration of 2%, where germination rates were drastically reduced. This dose-dependent
                            response is consistent with the findings of Tavares et al. (2011), who reported that piperine
                            inhibited germination in dicotyledonous plants at higher concentrations. However, unlike the monocot
                            Allium cepa, which showed stimulated germination in the presence of piperine, maize seeds exhibited
                            inhibition, indicating species-specific responses among monocots to piperamides.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test confirmed significant
                            differences between the control and all piperamide treatments (p &lt; 0.05), as further supported by
                            Dunn's post hoc test with Bonferroni correction (Figure 4). Notably, there were no significant
                            differences among the piperamide treatments themselves, implying that even minimal concentrations
                            can substantially inhibit maize seed germination. This lack of significant difference between
                            varying concentrations suggests a threshold effect, where any presence of piperamides above a
                            minimal level adversely affects germination.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">The distribution analysis of germinated versus non-germinated seeds (Figure 2)
                            reinforced this observation, showing an increased proportion of non-germinated seeds with higher
                            piperamide concentrations. This trend indicates that the application of piperamide-based
                            biopesticides could potentially compromise maize crop viability if not carefully managed. The
                            sensitivity of maize seeds to piperamides raises concerns about their direct application to the
                            substrate in agricultural settings.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Our findings highlight a critical consideration for the use of piperamides as
                            biopesticides in maize cultivation. While piperamides are known for their insecticidal properties
                            against pests like the fall armyworm (<em>Spodoptera frugiperda</em>), their phytotoxic effects on
                            maize seeds present a significant obstacle. The contrasting responses between maize y otros
                            monocotiledóneos como <em>Allium cepa</em> sugieren que la fitotoxicidad de los piperamides no es
                            uniforme en las especies monocotiledóneas. Esta discrepancia subraya la importancia de evaluaciones
                            fitotóxicas específicas para cada cultivo al desarrollar biopesticidas.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Several factors could contribute to the observed phytotoxicity in maize seeds.
                            Piperamides may interfere with crucial physiological processes during germination, such as enzyme
                            activity, hormonal regulation, or membrane integrity. The high lipophilicity of piperamides might
                            facilitate their penetration into seed tissues, leading to intracellular disruptions that inhibit
                            germination. Further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which piperamides
                            affect maize seeds.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Given the adverse effects observed even at the lowest concentration tested,
                            alternative strategies must be considered to mitigate the phytotoxic impact of piperamides on maize.
                            Possible approaches include:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Formulation Adjustments:</strong> Developing controlled-release formulations or
                                encapsulation techniques that reduce direct exposure of seeds to piperamides, potentially by
                                targeting the active compound more precisely at the pest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Applying piperamide-based biopesticides at stages when
                                maize seeds have already germinated and seedlings have developed past the most vulnerable
                                stages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Combination with Safeners:</strong> Investigating the use of safener compounds that
                                could protect maize seeds from the phytotoxic effects of piperamides without diminishing their
                                insecticidal efficacy.</li>
                        </ul>Additionally, field studies are essential to assess whether environmental factors such as soil
                        composition, microbial activity, and climatic conditions might mitigate the phytotoxic effects observed
                        under controlled laboratory conditions. In natural settings, factors like soil adsorption, degradation
                        by microorganisms, and dilution could reduce the effective concentration of piperamides reaching the
                        seeds.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Our study also highlights the need for comprehensive risk assessments when
                            introducing new biopesticides into agricultural practices. While the goal is to develop effective
                            pest control methods that are environmentally friendly, it is crucial to ensure that these methods
                            do not inadvertently harm the crops they are intended to protect. The balance between pest control
                            efficacy and crop safety must be carefully managed.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">In conclusion, although piperamides exhibit promising insecticidal properties
                            against pests like the fall armyworm, their inhibitory effects on maize seed germination present
                            significant challenges for their use in maize cultivation. Our findings suggest that direct
                            application of piperamides to the substrate is not advisable due to the high sensitivity of maize
                            seeds. Future research should focus on developing application methods that minimize phytotoxicity,
                            understanding the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects, and evaluating the performance of
                            piperamide-based biopesticides under realistic agricultural conditions. By addressing these
                            challenges, it may be possible to harness the benefits of piperamides for pest control while
                            ensuring the safety and viability of maize crops in sustainable agriculture.</p>
