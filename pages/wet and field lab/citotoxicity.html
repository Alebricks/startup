                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The increasing demand for environmentally friendly and sustainable agricultural practices has intensified
                    interest in natural compounds with biopesticidal properties. Piperamides, naturally occurring alkaloids
                    found in black pepper (<em>Piper nigrum</em>), have emerged as promising candidates due to their
                    demonstrated insecticidal, antifungal, and antimicrobial activities. These properties make piperamides
                    attractive for use as biopesticides in integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, which aim to reduce
                    reliance on synthetic chemicals and minimize environmental impact.</p>
                <p>To meet the growing need for such natural bioactive compounds, biotechnological production of piperamides
                    using microbial systems has become a focal point of research. <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, a
                    well-characterized model organism for metabolic engineering, is an ideal host for the biosynthesis of
                    piperamides. In this engineered pathway, ferulic acid serves as a critical intermediate metabolite. Although
                    ferulic acid has its own bioactive properties, its primary role in this context is to serve as a precursor
                    in the piperamide biosynthetic route. However, one of the key challenges in scaling up piperamide production
                    in microbial systems is understanding the cytotoxic effects of both piperamides and ferulic acid on <em>S.
                        cerevisiae</em> cells.</p>
                <p>High concentrations of these compounds could potentially reduce cell viability, limiting the efficiency of
                    the production process in bioreactors. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the concentration thresholds at
                    which piperamides and ferulic acid begin to exert toxic effects on the host cells.</p>
                <p>In this study, we conducted cytotoxicity assays using automated cell counting and flow cytometry to assess
                    the impact of various concentrations of piperamides and ferulic acid on <em>S. cerevisiae</em>. The goal is
                    to optimize the conditions for large-scale biopesticide production, ensuring that piperamide yields are
                    maximized without compromising cell health. The insights gained from this research will contribute to the
                    development of scalable, microbial-based production systems for piperamides, facilitating their use as
                    sustainable biopesticides in agricultural applications.</p>

                            for 45 minutes. The viability was measured using an automated cell counter and trypan blue.</p>
                        <p>We did this exploratory assay in order to find the concentrations that were cytotoxic to the cells.

                        <p>For the case of piperamides, we just started to assess with the concentration that can be found in

                                do have a cytotoxic effect on yeast cells, and also that the concentration that has a cytotoxic
                                effect is between 0.2% and 2%.</p>
                            <p>The concentrations of ferulic acid that we tried show almost the same cell viability, so this

                        </figure>Figure 2 and Table 1 demonstrate that increasing the concentration of ferulic acid leads to a
                        corresponding increase in cell death. A similar effect is observed with higher concentrations of
                        piperamides. For ferulic acid, we found that a concentration of 0.01% resulted in cell viability very
                        similar to the negative control (ETOH), with values of 93.5% and 94%, respectively. In contrast, a
                        concentration of 1% led to a cell viability of 84%. Therefore, we concluded that further assessment of
                        concentrations between 0.01% and 1% is needed to determine the inflection point at which ferulic acid
                        begins to damage the cells. For piperamides we found that the lowest concentration tested in this assay,
                        0.6%, resulted in significantly reduced cell viability (9.91%). When comparing the viability at 0.2%
                        piperamides (71%, Figure 1) to that at 0.6% (9.91%, Table 1), it is evident that further investigation
                        between these concentrations is required to identify the inflection point where piperamides exert a
                        pronounced cytotoxic effect.<figure id="figure-cell-sorter" class="my-5 text-center"><img

                            <h3>Discussion</h3>
                            <p>In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of piperamides and ferulic acid on
                                <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> to assess their suitability in metabolic pathway design for
                                biosynthesis applications. Using both automated cell counting with trypan blue exclusion and
                                flow cytometry with Zombie NIR™ viability dye, we quantified cell viability across a range of
                                concentrations for both compounds.</p>
                            <p>Our initial assays using the automated cell counter indicated that piperamides exhibit
                                significant cytotoxicity at higher concentrations. Specifically, at concentrations of 2% and 5%,
                                cell viability decreased markedly to 37% and 21%, respectively (Figure 1). In contrast, ferulic
                                acid did not show significant cytotoxic effects across the tested concentrations up to 0.4%,
                                maintaining cell viability around 84%. These results suggest that piperamides are inherently
                                more toxic to yeast cells than ferulic acid at equivalent concentrations.</p>
                            <p>Flow cytometry assays corroborated these findings and provided more detailed insights.
                                Piperamides at concentrations of 0.6%, 1.2%, and 1.8% resulted in cell viabilities of 9.91%,
                                6.95%, and 1.06%, respectively (Table 1). The steep decline in viability at concentrations above
                                0.6% indicates a pronounced cytotoxic effect, emphasizing the need to carefully regulate
                                intracellular levels of piperamides in engineered yeast strains. Ferulic acid demonstrated a
                                dose-dependent but less severe cytotoxicity. Even at the highest concentration tested (0.0004%),
                                cell viability remained at 64%, suggesting that yeast cells can tolerate higher concentrations
                                of ferulic acid compared to piperamides.</p>
                            <p>An unexpected observation was the high viability in the positive control (6% hydrogen peroxide)
                                during the automated cell counter assay, which contradicted established knowledge of hydrogen
                                peroxide's oxidative cytotoxicity. This anomaly could be due to experimental error, such as
                                incorrect reagent concentration, or it might reflect an adaptive oxidative stress response in
                                yeast cells. However, in the flow cytometry assay, the hydrogen peroxide control resulted in
                                expected cytotoxicity, with cell viability dropping to 0.13% and dead cells comprising 99.2% of
                                the population. This discrepancy highlights the importance of assay validation and suggests that
                                flow cytometry provides a more accurate assessment of cell viability in this context.</p>
                            <p>The morphological differences between live and dead cells observed via flow cytometry further
                                confirmed the cytotoxic effects of the compounds tested. Live cells displayed larger sizes and
                                greater internal complexity, while dead cells were smaller with irregular shapes (Figure 3).
                                These structural changes are consistent with cellular responses to toxic stress and support the
                                quantitative viability data obtained.</p>
                            <p>Our findings have significant implications for the metabolic engineering of <em>S.
                                    cerevisiae</em> for the biosynthesis of piperamides and ferulic acid. The cytotoxicity of
                                piperamides at relatively low concentrations suggests that overproduction or accumulation within
                                the cells could compromise cell viability and, consequently, the efficiency of bioproduction
                                processes. Strategies such as dynamic regulation of pathway expression, efflux pumps to export
                                piperamides, or compartmentalization might be necessary to mitigate cytotoxic effects. In
                                contrast, the higher tolerance of yeast cells to ferulic acid indicates that its biosynthesis
                                might be more feasible without extensive cellular modifications.</p>
                            <p>Limitations of this study include the need for more precise determination of the cytotoxic
                                concentration thresholds for both compounds. For piperamides, further assays with concentrations
                                between 0.2% and 0.6% could help identify the inflection point where cytotoxicity becomes
                                significant. Similarly, for ferulic acid, testing concentrations between 0.01% and 1% would
                                refine our understanding of its impact on cell viability. Additionally, investigating the
                                mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects—such as membrane disruption, reactive oxygen species
                                generation, or metabolic interference—could provide deeper insights and inform engineering
                                strategies.</p>

                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>In conclusion, while ferulic acid appears to be a suitable intermediate for yeast-based
                                biosynthesis with minimal cytotoxicity, piperamides pose a challenge due to their pronounced
                                toxic effects at higher concentrations. Future work should focus on optimizing yeast strains and
                                metabolic pathways to balance efficient production with cell health, ensuring sustainable
                                biotechnological applications of these compounds.</p>
