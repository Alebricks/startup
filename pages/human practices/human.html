            <h1 class="my-4 pt-4">Human Practices</h1>
            <p>Our purpose at Human Practices is to study the impact of our proposal in the real world, considering the social,
                cultural, environmental, and economic context, always in a respectful manner and attached to our values, ethics,
                and morals that represent us as a team. The main motivation is to be participants in a positive metamorphosis in
                society.</p>
            <p>To assimilate these aspects we must approach the agents that make up the corn environment, understand their
                norms, codes of conduct, and cultural issues to establish a broad communication channel in which the parties can
                contribute to each other.</p>
            <p>We consider that keeping an open mind to new postulates is essential for learning and feedback from the project,
                at the same time that we will achieve our participation with the dissemination of synthetic biology. This will
                help us promote, educate, and create trust in the product, so that it can be well received.</p>
            <h4 class="my-4">Problem in our local area</h4>
            <p>From our vision, as young Mexicans concerned about the social, environmental, and economic panorama, we began to
                interpret the events that caused us concern every day. An important factor that focused our attention on corn (a
                food that we have in our daily diet) was the significant increase in its price. Bearing in mind that there are
                various factors at a global level that can alter the cost of corn, it was worth approaching the producers of
                this grain, and knowing the context they were witnessing.</p>
            <p>We recognized immediate interest in this topic, since we determined that corn is an important cereal in our
                culture, that it appears worldwide and that we are proudly willing to contribute efforts in order to benefit our
                society. The main corn producing states in Mexico are: Sinaloa, Jalisco, Michoacán, State of Mexico, Guanajuato,
                Guerrero, Veracruz, and Chiapas. Sinaloa alone contributes 23% of the total production in the country, followed
                by Jalisco, which participates with 14.4%. (Servicio de Información Agroalimentaria y Pesquera, 2020).</p>
            <p>Cruz, a member of the team and son of José, a farmer from the municipality of Cosalá, Sinaloa, Mexico, told us
                about an alarming situation that many farmers face today. The main threat is centered on the fall armyworm, a
                pest that attacks corn fields and puts their livelihood at risk. However, Cruz's real concern lies in the use of
                conventional pesticides that are used to attack it. One afternoon, while his father was spraying his cornfield
                with these pesticides, he suffered a sudden dizziness that left him shaking.</p>
            <p>A terrifying experience that made him reflect on the dangers of the chemicals he used to protect his crops. Cruz
                understood that these fainting spells were a consequence of his father's effort to take care of his harvest, but
                he wondered: what choice does he really have? The anguish of choosing between their health and the survival of
                their crops became an increasingly heavy burden.</p>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Pesticides play an important role in the current agricultural model, since their application during the
                    vegetative period of various crops in the world allows improving production by eliminating the pests and
                    diseases that attack them.</p>
                <p>However, today it is known that excessive use without measure has a high impact on the environment,
                    generating risks for those who use them – the FAO and WHO estimate that more than four million people are
                    likely to be poisoned each year due to their exposure to toxic pesticides – in addition to the health
                    dangers they can cause to consumers. In recent decades, various methods have been developed that seek to
                    reduce these negative effects and are in line with sustainable agriculture. (Government of Mexico, 2020).
                </p>
                <p>Guiding our research towards a direct, measurable, and achievable purpose, we study the different pests
                    present in the crops.</p>
                <p>From the Secretariat of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Government of Mexico (2021), declared that
                    among the foliage pests that most attack corn crops are: Fall armyworm, Corn earworm, Armyworm, and Red
                    spider. And about the rhizophages (which attack the root): Blind hen, Wireworm, and Diabrotica.</p>
                <p>We investigated these pests and, highly sensitive to the situation that Cruz shared with us, we decided to
                    focus on first attacking the Fall Armyworm through a biopesticide that is friendly to the environment and
                    human health. After reaching our goal, we will be able to channel other pests to develop a comprehensive and
                    effective product.</p>
                <p>For the aforementioned reasons, the project problem was selected.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2 class="my-4">Complexity of the Problem</h2>
                <p>No matter how much a public problem may seem to have few causes, in reality it is never simple. When trying
                    to address it, one issue tends to generate another, and the fabric can continue to extend through space and
                    even history in search of the true origin of a situation.</p>
                <p>That is why it is crucial to define the problem in order to understand it and facilitate its intervention. In
                    this way, we identify categories of various complexities, allowing us to recognize the immediate problem and
                    its causes.</p>
                <p>If the problem to be addressed is “X”, “U”, “V” and “W” must be understood, as they are its predecessors, in
                    order to establish a double line of action:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Containment of the existing problem, in a relatively present moment, to prevent it from evolving and
                        growing.</li>
                    <li>Prevention of the problem, addressing its causes to prevent it from recurring in the future.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Both principles can be supported when the present dynamics of the problem, its context, and its origins are
                    known. Once all this is understood, intervention strategies can begin to be created.</p>
                <p>Although this principle responds to the theory of public policy creation in Latin America, we as a team
                    learned it empirically thanks to our Human Practices work for Design League 2021. We visited the Santiago
                    River, guided by activists from Un Salto de Vida A.C., a non-profit civil association in Juanacatlán,
                    Jalisco, which seeks solutions to the environmental problems present in that region due to pollution of the
                    Río Santiago, a major water basin.</p>
                <p>Our contact with the organization occurred at the beginning of the project, when we noticed they addressed
                    social and environmental issues aligned with our values and objectives.</p>
                <p>We approached them to understand the possible implications of a project with these characteristics. Thanks to
                    this, we realized that environmental and human health problems have diverse causes, touching on economic and
                    cultural aspects, where private initiative can be strongly involved, and public policies and regulations at
                    the federal, state, and local levels have a direct impact on people's quality of life. Therefore, we
                    investigated the problem more deeply.</p>
                <p>Initially, our lab proposal was a bioreactor for detecting heavy metals. However, despite its potential, its
                    impact was limited due to the economic and political conflicts behind the pollution. The bioreactor would
                    have limited ability to prevent diseases given the social conditions, though it could serve as a tool for
                    generating scientific evidence to aid in the processes organizations and groups were working on.</p>
                <p>With this experience, we understood the importance of knowing and understanding a context before generating a
                    proposal. And when facing a problem, it is important to consider the short and long term, the direct and
                    indirect impact, and the complexity of the issue.</p>

                <h2 class="my-4">Stakeholder's Map</h2>
                <p>Before starting the field research, we stopped to analyze the actors involved in our project. This is
                    essential in order to consider the sectors that can intervene directly or indirectly, as well as their level
                    of influence. According to the analysis, we will know who it is wise to go to.</p>
                <p>The tool that best suits our needs is a “Stakeholder Map”, as it conceptualizes four districts based on two
                    variables: power and interest.</p>

            <h2 class="my-4">Promoters</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Farmers: We must approach this class to listen to them, know their expectations and needs, disseminate
                    synthetic biology, transmit security, and establish a communication link to maintain constant contact.</li>
                <li>Investors: For a team like ours, composed mostly of university students, it is essential to have financial
                    resources to develop schemes like this. Our plan will be to develop “elevator pitch” style formats,
                    presentations, and infographics to present the project in a clear, attractive, and concise manner to seek
                    capital investment.</li>
                <li>Government: Approach the corresponding institution to ensure compliance with the guidelines they request,
                    thus facilitating the necessary procedures and tests for approval.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="my-4">Latents</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Traders (Intermediaries): We consider them great allies. If we provide an attractive proposal, they will be
                    able to promote and offer our product.</li>
                <li>Pesticide Industry: No possible alliance. Our link will be the study of your market to consider the
                    characteristics that the product should have.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="my-4">Defenders</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consumers of Organic Products:</strong> We will reach them through social networks, generating
                    informative content about the benefits of the product, its impact on the environment, people's health, and
                    social responsibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Communities:</strong> We will assist communities directly related to this activity, educating
                    them on what is being developed and how their environment will benefit.</li>
                <li><strong>Civil Organizations:</strong> They are key allies. They possess knowledge in the field, so we can
                    generate strategic alliances.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Defenders (Activists):</strong> Like civil organizations, we can establish
                    communication to generate confidence in the product and spread awareness, just as they do with other
                    environmentally responsible products.</li>

            <h2 class="my-4">PEST Analysis</h2>
            <p>After analyzing each of the actors involved in the present, it is time to study the external factors that can
                impact us. The tool we select for this purpose is a “PEST Analysis,” since it considers political, economic,
                social, and technological conditions. With this, we will be clear about our environment and the possibility of
                how to behave in it.</p>
            <div class="text-center my-4"><img src="../../images/human practices/human/humanpractices-3.png"
                    alt="PEST Analysis" class="img-fluid"></div>
            <p>Having made these issues visible, we can focus the research in a determined way to meet our objective. This is
                how we can create a strategic and comprehensive plan that incorporates these points. We do not rule out that new
                events may come our way, and we will provide treatment as they arise.</p>
            <p>After this documentary research, we can begin the field research.</p>
            <h2 class="my-4">Preparation of the tool</h2>
            <p>To collect the model information, we opted for the interview tool. Not being experts in agriculture but already
                having a precedent of where to go, a field reconnaissance was carried out in the form of a semi-structured
                interview that allowed us to contextualize the situation and problems faced by Mexican farmers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p>We developed a first questionnaire with a few open-ended questions that would help resolve our main questions.
                The intention was to listen to a farmer with extensive experience in this field, to learn his criteria,
                environment, and obstacles, and thus empower us to create a broader questionnaire with precise questions to
                obtain enriching answers.</p>
            <h2 class="my-4">Farmer's Experience</h2>
            <p>We made this first approach with Mr. José Luis Torres, civil engineer, who is part of the third family generation
                that professes this work. His entire life has been dedicated to growing corn, raising farm animals, among other
                activities.</p>
            <p>He mentions that he has identified two main pests that affect the crop: the nixticuil and the fall armyworm. In
                the first case, it affects the root of the plant, weakening it and causing its death; in the second case, the
                worm lodges in the corncob, hindering the fertilization process and the subsequent growth of the ear or corn.
            </p>
            <p>Regarding his experience with chemical fertilizers and/or pesticides, Mr. José Luis stated that he uses these
                substances, which are in liquid form, so that when mixed with water, they permeate the soil more easily,
                enhancing its effect. This is particularly important in the control of the fall armyworm, as during the rainy
                season, these pesticides can mix with rainwater, penetrate the soil, and attack the pest more effectively.</p>
            <p>However, he is also aware that the use of these substances has side effects, such as damage to local flora.
                Still, he continues to use them because they are essential for maintaining productivity. He emphasized that it
                is crucial to follow the instructions correctly, use protective materials, and avoid direct contact with these
                substances.</p>
            <h2 class="my-4">The Importance of Prevention</h2>
            <p>Following the line of pest control, he mentioned that from his point of view, the most important thing is
                prevention, making it clear that correct planting and the timely use of fertilizers and pesticides are vital to
                achieving good results.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p>He also commented on some sociopolitical aspects linked to Mexican agriculture, affecting its outlook, such as
                the case of glyphosate, which was banned without the government providing effective alternatives. Added to this,
                support programs from the State are becoming less frequent, inputs for crop care have risen in price, and there
                is pressure to sell their land. As Mr. José Luis stated, “[...] Here, production in the countryside in most
                cases is for the love of art, for the love that people have for the land,” resulting in many of their colleagues
                having sold their lands.</p>
            <p>This conversation reaffirmed several points that we had valued in our bibliographic research, and we learned many
                others that had not been considered. We believe that the objective of this talk was met because we had the
                clarity to investigate competently.</p>
            <h2 class="my-4">Developing the Questionnaire</h2>
            <p>Based on this, we developed a new questionnaire with 4 demographic, 8 contextual, and 22 project-specific
                questions. To meet our research needs, the questions are mostly open-ended, and a few others are the combination
                of pre-coding with “yes and no,” expecting a broad explanation of the reason for their response.</p>
            <p>We believe that this is the best system to obtain the information we require, as we are in the investigation
                stage, so we hope that the interviewee expresses those aspects that we do not have in mind and that can
                undoubtedly add to the project.</p>
            <h2 class="my-4">Profile of the Interviewees</h2>
            <p>The profile of our interviewee must meet the following characteristics: indistinct sex, of legal age, indistinct
                nationality, must currently reside in Mexico, must have the job of growing corn, and practice it in Mexican
                territory. Most importantly, they must have witnessed fall armyworm in their fields on at least one occasion.
            </p>
            <p>In recognition of the right to protection of the personal data of those interviewed, and in accordance with the
                provisions of the Federal Law on Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Parties, a Comprehensive Privacy
                Notice on the Use of Personal Data was created.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="my-4">Application of the Interview to Farmers</h2>
            <p>We chose the states of Jalisco and Sinaloa as a sample, since they generate the highest corn production
                nationwide. To achieve rapprochement, we went to close circles that could link us to people who meet the
                aforementioned profile and thus agree on a date.</p>
            <p>We carry out the interviews according to the farmer's needs, adjusting to their times and conditions. This is how
                we arrange face-to-face meetings.</p>
            <p>Once we arrive at the agreed location, we introduce ourselves to the interviewees, deliver the privacy notice
                where we explain the data we require for the purposes of this project. Next, we mention that the voice recording
                starts, as well as inform when it ends.</p>
            <p>In this way, we carried out the interview. Part of the dynamic was that if the interviewee provided information
                that was outside the objective answer to the question asked but contributed to our study, the interviewer would
                ask follow-up questions to gather more information.</p>
            <p>In question 27, “Do you know what Synthetic Biology is or have you heard of it?”, if the interviewee answered
                “no,” we gave a brief explanation to provide context and answer the rest of the questions.</p>
