            <h1 class="display-4 text-center pt-4 mb-4">Integrated Human Practices</h1>
            <h2 class="mb-4">Overview</h2>
            <p>In this section we make a summary of Human practices being integrated into the project. Here we present some
                diagrams which synthesize our questions, reflections and findings from which we drew conclusions to work on
                purpose, design and execution of the project, shaping it. However, the instruments, basis, and procedures for
                the development of the complete research are discussed later with deeper detail.</p>
            <p>The current strategies to protect corn crops from the Fall armyworm have catastrophic consequences upon the
                environment and human health. It is a complex problem and bringing up a solution to it requires addressing the
                situation from diverse approaches.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="project-impact">
            <h4 class="mb-4">How is our project good for the world looking at the big picture?</h4>
            <p>It addresses a global need for responsible maize production, benefiting both producers and the environment by
                reducing the impact of conventional pesticides. Additionally, it serves as a tool for transitioning towards
                sustainable farming models.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="human-practices-shaping-project">
            <h4 class="mb-4">How did our Human Practices help us shape our project?</h4>
            <p>Understanding the global implications of the problem along with the local point of view led us to work on a
                biopesticide which addresses the interests and needs of the affected population, with an overall background
                understanding from where we could also use it to reach scenarios in which the problem is not only solved, but
                also prevented.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="project-design">
            <p>Design (Selection of the project): Understanding sociopolitical processes revealed that, although there are
                alternative farming methods where the pest isn't a significant issue, these cannot be applied immediately.
                Therefore, alternatives that protect crops without harming human health are urgently needed.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="project-execution">
            <p>Execution (Implementation of the product): This is a scalable project that is both affordable and practical for
                small and medium-sized producers. By approaching Agropip as an element of Integrated Pest Management within a
                strategy for transitioning farming systems, we can contribute to long-term shifts towards autonomous and
                sustainable agricultural models.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="taking-action">
            <h4 class="mb-4">How are we taking action and not just considering opinions?</h4>
            <p>We do not only address stakeholders for understanding the problem, but also adjust our approach seeking to reach
                a solution which can come back to those who need it the most, the farmers. Our project tends to health as a most
                imperative situation, stops degrading the soil and is meant to give autonomy to the producers, further non
                dependent on any kind of pesticides.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="stakeholder-diversity">
            <p>Stakeholder Diversity. Those getting the most direct impact of the problem and those trying to fight it come from
                different backgrounds and work with different perspectives under different conditions. Which is why we addressed
                producers, academics, governments and civil organizations for a wide range of perspectives. All from different
                parts of the country.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="why-address-stakeholders" class="mt-5">
            <p>Why We Addressed Them. To design something that addresses real needs, we must understand the actual conditions of
                those experiencing the problem. Understanding the root of the issue allows us to assess whether the proposed
                solution is viable. Furthermore, it enables us to seek an approach that can have a more profound impact.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="linking-with-stakeholders" class="mt-5">
            <p>Linking with Stakeholders. If the problem is complex, the approach must be multidisciplinary. In addition to the
                project's development in terms of design, understanding the work of stakeholders can guide us in identifying
                limitations, action paths, and potential collaborations to combine efforts. The justification for our
                identification of the stakeholders and what we learned from them fully presented on Human Practices and
                Integrated Human Practices.</p>

        <section id="thoughts" class="mt-5">
            <h4 class="mb-4">Thoughts</h4>
            <p><strong>Which needs are we prioritizing?</strong> The farmers' producing issues and consequences on current
                conditions.</p>
            <p><strong>Which values are we prioritizing?</strong> Recognition of subjects. Respect for diversities. Caring for
                life.</p>
            <p><strong>Our compromises?</strong> Developing a product which is affordable, safe and effective for stopping
                health and environmental impact for small and medium corn producers.</p>

            <h4 class="mb-4">Responsibilities</h4>
            <p>Communicate honestly possible positive and negative impact and how to prevent it:</p>
            <p>Agropip, being a product based on synthetic biology and designed for use in open fields, may have repercussions
                on the biodiversity of the areas where it is applied, as well as potential risks to human health.</p>
            <p>Our team is fully aware of the potential risks that Agropip presents, which is why our decision-making and
                problem-solving approach is grounded in field research, empirical and theoretical evidence, and mathematical
                modeling, always considering biosafety principles. Further discussed on Sustainable development - Negative
                Impact- and Safety.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="responsiveness" class="mt-5">
            <h4 class="mb-4">Responsiveness</h4>
            <p>HP in the team: As much as we recognize identities from those who we approach outside, we keep a horizontal
                decision making system inside the team, where we discuss and make the big decisions together.</p>
            <p><strong>Knowing our limits:</strong> By understanding the complexity of the problem we know what´s out of our
                reach, which involves characters playing key roles and what issues are more a matter of laws and politics, even
                culture, rather than Synthetic biology. That helped us find a specific pathway to work out through all those
                circumstances.</p>
            <p><strong>Recognizing existing work:</strong> That specific pathway wouldn't be possible without reaching out to
                our government, private sector and academics and civil organizations. We discuss the collaborations further in
                the section of our approach.</p>

                <p>The existing alternatives for the same pest are still dependent from 40 to 60% of pesticide usage, which
                    reduces the impact, but does not eliminate it. Which is why our biopesticide can still play an important
                    role in caring for the fields and its workers.</p>

                    economically this project fills missing links for better practices in the corn fields. Meanwhile, we confirm

                    experiences to which we had had direct contact. To learn these stories, go to local problems in Human
                    Practices, for diving into the field, even existential questions, go to Philosophies.</p>

                <p>It is essential to understand the dynamics that affect farmers and their contexts. This approach proved key
                    in identifying and analyzing the experiences of producers. Through the application of interviews, we have
                    gathered valuable information that provides a broad view of the challenges they face in their daily work,
                    particularly regarding pest management and the use of pesticides.</p>
                <p>This analysis has allowed us to assimilate the concerns and expectations of farmers, which will guide us in
                    designing effective strategies to connect with and support their needs.</p>

                <h5 class="mb-4">Demographic Data</h5>
                <p>The average age was 53.3 years, the maximum level of education that most of the interviewees had was up to
                    secondary school and all of them were Mexican nationals.</p>
                <p>Our sample was entirely made up of men, since it was not possible to contact women who are dedicated to this
                    activity (which we do not rule out), which shows the social stigma still present in our culture of how
                    certain occupations are socially accepted according to gender.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="socio-economic-context" class="mt-5">
                <h5 class="mb-4">Socio-economic Context</h5>
                <p>All of those interviewed are descendants of farmer parents, they were introduced to the sector from a very
                    young age, so this work activity was part of their education. Among the main motivations that their work
                    gives them is the economic income they receive and they declared that they enjoy contact with the
                    countryside.</p>
                <p>Even with the good points mentioned above, 80% of those consulted carry out another activity that remunerates
                    them financially because they comment that the profit obtained from agriculture is not satisfactory, which
                    is why they are forced to seek extra income through a different means.</p>
                <p>Another notable issue is that Jalisco farmers do receive government financial support (although a small
                    amount), while Sinaloa farmers do not receive any. This leads us to conclude that the state government of
                    Sinaloa does not provide sufficient incentives to boost the agricultural sector, despite the fact that it is
                    one of the states that contributes the most in crop production nationwide.</p>

                        the most frequent and complicated pests to treat. Other common pests exposed are: Whitefly, Blind Hen
                        and the Stem Borer.</p>
                    <p>They all stated that the use of pesticides is necessary to control pests and that they have used these
                        substances, even though the majority believe that they are not safe substances, they say they have no
                        other option.</p>

            <p>The majority of people who responded to our interview accept that they do not know the repercussions that the use
                of pesticides has in these two areas, as well as those who answered "yes" have limited knowledge of the scope
                that these chemical components added to their crops can have.</p>
            <p>A situation that creates alarm for us is that only half of our sample uses any safety protocol and specialized
                equipment to protect themselves when applying the pesticide. This is extremely dangerous since improper contact
                can lead to death.</p>
            <p>Despair, together with the rush to attack pests, has led several farmers to practice poor agricultural practices,
                for example: applying more doses of pesticides or mixing several, which increases the negative environmental and
                health impact.</p>

                    contact with pesticides; their experience, recommendations, and opinions are highly valuable to consider the

            <p>The environmental and human health damage caused by the chemical pesticides that currently lead the food industry
                is excessive, adding that in Mexico the use of substances that are currently prohibited in agriculture
                continues. In other countries, this reveals the deficiencies on the part of our government in implementing
                public policies that regulate their management.</p>
            <p>Although there are many interests through different people who care little about the negative impact they can
                cause, it is worth dictating a change for the benefit of society, specifically those who are in the most
                vulnerable link in the chain.</p>
            <p>Our project focuses on providing a substance that meets the highest health standards and that its impact does not
                affect the environment.</p>
            <p>To verify if it is viable to extend a project of this magnitude, we devised an analysis of the events that we can
