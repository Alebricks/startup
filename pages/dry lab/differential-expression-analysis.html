                <p class="card-text text-justify">In order to find the other enzymes present in the biosynthetic pathway, a
                    differential expression analysis was performed in the same way piperine synthase and other enzymes have been
                    discovered. RNAseq data from four different tissues of P. nigrum were used; these tissues were leaf,
                    flowering spadix, and black pepper fruits at two different stages: 20-30 days post anthesis and 40-60 days
                    post anthesis; each tissue was represented by three biological replicates, having a total of 12 samples.
                    From now on, the spadix of the panicle will be referred to just as panicle. The mature fruit (40 days post
                    anthesis) has the highest piperine and piperamide concentration from all the four tissues studied;
                    considering this, it is expected that the genes over-expressed in mature fruit in comparison with the other
                    tissues are related to piperine/piperidine biosynthesis.</p>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">The RNAseq data were obtained from the SRA database with BioProject ID:
                    PRJEB38192; the sequencing technology used was Illumina HiSeq 2000 paired end sequencing. The average number
                    of reads per run was 35.46 Mbp, the quality of the reads was evaluated by using FastQC, a quality control
                    tool for high-throughput sequence data, and summarized with MultiQC. The reads were checked for adapter
                    content and these were removed with Trimmomatic. The sequences were also quality trimmed using a sliding
                    window of four nucleotides and a required average quality of 20, with a minimum length of 125 bp. After the
                    raw data of the samples were cleaned, the average number of reads per run was 27.08 Mbp. The cleaned reads
                    were mapped to the CDS sequences of the reference genome of P. nigrum by using Kallisto.</p>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">With the count values obtained from the mapping, a differential expression
                    analysis (DEA) was performed using the DESeq2 algorithm, a method for differential analysis of count data,
                    using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of
                    estimates. With this data, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed, and can be seen in the next
                    figure. The principal component number one, which contains 56% of the variance of the data, can
                    differentiate between both the immature and mature fruit samples and the leaf and spadix tissues; the second
                    component, with 36% of the variance, differentiates clearly between leaf and panicle tissues. Even though
                    there is a distinction between both fruit stages, they cannot be differentiated completely with this
                    analysis, which indicates that there is a lot of similarity in the gene expression of both stages.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-justify">The differential expression analysis found 17,071 differentially expressed
                    genes across the selected tissues; these genes form an expression pattern for every tissue in the analysis.
                    These genes were selected using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) to verify if they were significantly expressed
                    in a different way across tissues. Genes with an absolute log2FoldChange value greater than one and an
                    adjusted p-value lower than 0.05 in comparisons between mature fruit and every other tissue were considered
                    as differentially expressed in mature fruit. These results can be seen in the next figures.</p>

                    with every other tissue studied was performed; these results were verified by the LRT with an adjusted
                    p-value lower than 0.01 and an absolute log<sup>2</sup>FoldChange greater than 1. The results showed that
                    19,918 genes were differentially expressed in mature fruit in comparison with some tissue, but only 526 were
                    in comparison to all tissues. From these genes, 10,972 were over-expressed in comparison with some tissue
                    and only 223 genes were over-expressed in comparison to all tissues. From these genes, only those selected
                    by hypothesis testing by LRT were conserved; 15,275 genes were differentially expressed in mature fruit in
                    comparison with some tissue, but only 523 were in comparison to all tissues. This represents a reduction of
                    three genes that were not considered as differentially expressed to all tissues after the hypothesis
                    testing. From these genes, 9,022 were over-expressed in comparison with some tissue and 223 genes were
                    over-expressed in comparison to all tissues; here we can see that there was no reduction in the number of

                    transcriptome profile was made. The heatmap shows the gene expression level for all the samples; the genes
                    are clustered in eight clusters found by k-means, and the number of adequate clusters was selected by the
                    elbow method using the total within sum of squares of the cluster. The clusters 1, 2, and 7 are those of
                    interest since they contain the genes over-expressed in mature fruit in comparison to all tissues, probably
                    involved in the biosynthesis of piperamides.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-justify">The second gene most over-expressed in mature fruit is annotated as a
                    terpenoid cyclases/protein prenyltransferases superfamily protein by the GeneFamilyClassifier tool. This
                    gene has the highest log<sup>2</sup>FoldChange found (12.69) and an adjusted p-value of 9.74 ×
                    10<sup>-129</sup>. We propose that this enzyme could perform the step nine of the proposed biosynthetic
                    pathway. In order to support this hypothesis, a molecular docking methodology was performed, as with the
                    other proposed enzymes. Even though enzymes 5 and 6 are characterized for the synthesis of piperine, these
                    enzymes cannot act on ligands with two fewer carbons like the proposed piperamide. For enzyme five, the gene
                    Pn7.1626 was selected based on its similarity with the characterized protein (ID: QQS74306), with 76.908%
                    identity and E-value ≊ 0. For enzyme number six, the selected gene was Pn16.1198; the protein produced from
                    this gene is annotated as a 4-coumarate:CoA ligase 2, which is the expected activity for the enzyme. It has
                    a 75.632% identity with the known enzyme (ID: QGY72664), and it is the sixth over-expressed gene in mature
                    fruit with a log<sup>2</sup>FoldChange of 7.31 and an adjusted p-value of 5.89 × 10<sup>-81</sup>. Its
                    expression is higher in mature fruit than the known protein, which is the 189th over-expressed gene with a
                    log<sup>2</sup>FoldChange of 1.84 and an adjusted p-value of 9.78 × 10<sup>-7</sup>.</p>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">The piperine synthase (ID: QUS53100) cannot act on an acyl donor two carbons
                    shorter than its normal substrate, piperoyl-CoA, but a similar enzyme called piperamide synthase (ID:
                    QUS53101) can act on a wider variety of acyl donors, including the 3,4-methylenedioxy cinnamoyl CoA, which
                    is the compound involved in our proposed biosynthetic pathway. The piperine synthase corresponds to the gene
                    Pn12.1813; this gene is annotated as a HXXXD-type acyl-transferase family protein, which is the reaction
                    type performed by the piperine synthase. This gene is over-expressed in the mature fruit in position 95,
                    with a log<sup>2</sup>FoldChange of 4.77 and an adjusted p-value of 1.19 × 10<sup>-20</sup>.</p>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">The piperamide synthase corresponds to the gene Pn6.2477; this gene is also
                    annotated as a HXXXD-type acyl-transferase family protein. This gene is over-expressed in the mature fruit
                    in position 56, with a log<sup>2</sup>FoldChange of 5.44 and an adjusted p-value of 1.89 × 10<sup>-34</sup>.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">The three remaining enzymes were selected from the literature. Three of the
                    genes selected were found over-expressed in the mature fruit, where the piperine and piperamides are present
                    in the highest concentration in the plant. This expression pattern can be thought of as a temporal
                    expression program for the biosynthetic pathway; in this way, the different transcriptional units were
                    designed, and the expression pattern of the construct works in a similar way to the temporal model found in
                    the expression pattern of the pathway in <em>Piper nigrum</em>.</p>
