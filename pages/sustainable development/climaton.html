        <section id="competition" class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="text-primary">The competition</h2>
            <p>We participated in the fourth edition of El Climaton UNAM, a nationwide competition aimed at mobilizing young
                people to tackle the climate emergency in Mexico. Organized by UNICEF and UNAM, this initiative fosters
                collective action and environmental awareness. We are proud to have won 3rd place with our project, Piper (which
                name we changed to Agropip). You can check them out on Instagram as @climatonunam.</p>
            <div class="text-center"><img src="../../images/sustainable development/climaton/climaton-1.png"
                    alt="" class="img-fluid my-3"></div>
            <p>It consisted of six phases over a period of about 50 days. It was a comprehensive experience that focused on
                providing us with a deep understanding of climate change in Mexico as well as giving us access to various
                spaces, such as panel discussions with experts, personalized advice to receive constructive feedback, idea labs,
                mentoring with specialists in various areas, constant evaluations, and collaborations between teams.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="feedback" class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="text-primary">Feedback and improvements to the project</h2>
            <p>The feedback we received during the Climaton was transformative and completely changed the way we viewed Agropip.
                One of the most impactful insights was the emphasis on not becoming overly attached to our solution, despite the
                significant effort we had invested. The experts stressed that for our project to truly make a difference, our
                commitment needed to be to solving the problem, not to preserving our original idea. As a result, they
                challenged us to temporarily let go of our solution and explore alternative approaches, in case our initial plan
                did not work as expected.</p>
            <p>This exercise led us to propose an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy, aligning with SDG 2 (Zero Hunger)
                by promoting resilient agricultural practices. Instead of relying solely on one solution, we developed a
                multidisciplinary approach aimed at fostering a more sustainable farming system. This strategy combined activism
                to push for improved governance and legislation with direct engagement with farmers to understand their
                perspectives.</p>
            <p>We also recognized the urgent need to educate farmers about pesticide safety, addressing SDG 3 (Good Health and
                Well-Being), as many farmers overlook safety precautions, leading to pesticide poisoning and health risks.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="gender-perspective" class="mb-5">
            <p>We learned the importance of incorporating a gender perspective into our solution, aligning with SDG 5 (Gender
                Equality). In Mexico, the majority of farmers (about 80%) are men, and they are directly impacted by
                agricultural challenges. Therefore, our approach must be sensitive to the prevailing culture of masculinity in
                rural areas.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, women often handle household tasks and face a different set of challenges, such as dealing
                with pesticide runoff that contaminates water supplies. This made us realize the importance of addressing the
                issue from various angles to ensure it resonates with all stakeholders.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="sustainable-farming" class="mb-5">
            <p>We gained insights into sustainable farming techniques that contribute to environmental resilience and pest
                control, supporting SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). Practices like polyculture (growing
                multiple crops together) can reduce the likelihood of pest outbreaks. In Mexico, several traditional farming
                methods, such as the Milpa system, could be promoted to improve both environmental and human well-being.
                Furthermore, biological control became a vital alternative, as natural predators of the fall armyworm could be
                utilized to manage pest populations, which ties into SDG 15 (Life on Land) by emphasizing the preservation of
                biodiversity and ecosystem health. Maize fields located in more biodiverse areas tend to support a greater
                number of natural predators, highlighting the need for ecosystem preservation.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="field-tests" class="mb-5">
            <p>During the Climaton, we received advice and evaluation to conducted field tests in Cosala, Sinaloa, using a
                prototype of Agropip, an extract of piperamides not produced through synthetic biology. We were strongly
                encouraged to take this step, as it was crucial for assessing the project's viability. As outlined in the Field
                Work section, these tests yielded positive results, reinforcing the potential of our solution to address the
                challenges we aim to tackle.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="consultations" class="mb-5">
            <p>Throughout the Climaton, we benefited from exclusive consultations with experts in various fields. A biologist
                and activist from Greenpeace, a climatologist specializing in water systems, and a veterinarian focused on the
                relationship between agriculture and global warming all provided valuable insights. Their feedback emphasized
                the importance of a robust business plan, which we later developed for iGEM and made available in the
                corresponding section of this wiki.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="climate-action" class="mb-5">
            <p>Another key recommendation was to be mindful of horizontal gene transfer when working with antibiotic resistance
                markers. This advice led us to integrate our construct into the genome for better biosafety, addressing SDG 3
                (Good Health and Well-Being) by improving biosecurity. Additionally, we were reminded that no system can be 100%
                sustainable, and that while our solution is promising, it may have unintended effects on native insect species.
                This prompted us to focus on optimizing its implementation to minimize environmental impact.</p>
            <p>As this was a climate change competition, one major critique was the need to emphasize the connection between our
                project and SDG 13 (Climate Action) more clearly. We established that pesticides severely damage ecosystems,
                which play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate. This degradation reduces the planet's resilience to
                climate change and can even exacerbate it. Furthermore, climate change facilitates the spread of pests,
                increasing reliance on hazardous pesticides, thereby creating a vicious cycle. The interconnection between these

            <p>Winning the 3rd prize was not the only reward, since participating in this initiative provided us with one of the
                most valuable tools we can imagine: the opportunity to establish meaningful connections with experts in diverse
                areas. These relationships not only enriched our experience during this period, but also made it possible for us
                to maintain contact for future consultations. The willingness of these professionals to continue sharing their
                knowledge and support is an invaluable resource that will allow us to continue improving the project and
                deepening our capabilities.</p>
